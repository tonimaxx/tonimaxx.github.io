In this discussion session, please include a short, sequential response ID at the end of each response, using the format RID#[number] or R#[number]. This will help me reference or reply to specific responses easily.

For example:
	•	If I want to refer to the third response, I will say, ‘Regarding RID#3…’ or ‘About R#3…’.

This structure will keep the discussion organized and efficient.
